# Line Following Robot

## Portfolio Page
More information about the line following robot can be found at my portfolio page here. Feel free to check it out!

## Hardware
This robot was run on a Raspberry Pi Pico H (motor controller) and a Raspberry Pi Zero W (image processor). In concert, these two helped the two wheel robot, powered by hobbyist brushed DC motors, was able to follow a line. To capture images I used Raspberry Pi camera module compatable with the Zero W. Finally, an H-bridge is required to power the motors. With this hardware setup you will be able to upload my code to these controllers and run a robot of your own!

## Other files
In addition to the image processing code and motor control code, this repo includes some image captures from the robot during its run.
